This is the code used to analyze data on Portland neighborhoods, ADU permitting, and AirBnBs. Code is in the ipynb file and figures are in the figures folder. Data is not included but if you have any questions about where I got it feel free to ask. Code will be updated with further analyses and data as they are completed. Find the project write up on Medium @ https://medium.com/@nhcampanelli
